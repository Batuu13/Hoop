# Hoop
This is a backend side of my project written in java. It has two parts: Restful API and websocket server.

* Resources directory contains the URL mappings.
* Services directory contains All of the functions and database querries.

This project still has some unfinished features as well as minor bugs.

What you can do with this backend:

* Login and Logout
* Register
* Browse rooms according to your GPS
* Message those rooms
* Look peoples profiles
* Add people as friends
* Privately message your friends
* Get notifications for your actions
* Have a profile and design it
